							Entity Framework core
								---------------------

* ORM -:
	- To address the data access requirements of ASP.NET CORE MVC application , you can use an 
	  ORM (OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING) framework .
	- An ORM framework :
	- Simplifies the process of accessing data from application.
	- ORM is tool for storing data from domain object (Model classes) to relational database (Sql Server DB) .


* Entity Framework Core :
	- it is ORM , it is open source , lightweight ,extensible and a cross plateform version of Entity Framework .

	- it is an enhancement to ADO.NET that gives developers an automated mechnism for acessing and storing data in the database.

* EF Core Development Approches 
	- EF Core supports two develpment approches .
	- 1> Code First
	- 2> DataBase First

* EF Core DataBase Providers
	
	- Example -: SQL , MYSQL , POSTGRE SQL

	EF Core ======>>>>>>    DATABASE PROVIDER  ==================>>>>>> DATABASE 



											CODE FIRST APPROACH
											===================

- In this approach, the Entity Framework Core creates database objects based on model classes that 
  you create to represent application data .
- The code-first approach allows you to define your model by creating custom classes .
- then, you can create database based on models .


step 1> install Entity framework Core from manage nuget package . Database providers
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
step 2> Create Model class and database contect class
		it is interact with database using DbContext with namespace using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; 
step 3> Create connection string and add dependency in startup.cs file
step 4> Create Controller with views
step 5> Create migration by using this command "add-migration <name>"
		Ex : add migration InitialCreate

step 6> Then type "update-database" command




 **** Database First APPROACH


Scaffold-DbContext "Server=LAPTOP-8IBNPKQ5\\MSSQLSERVERNEW;Database=StudentEntityDbFirst;Trusted_Connection=True;" 
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models

command for database first approach
